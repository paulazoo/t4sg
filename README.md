## Information

- Brief demo and overview of features

- How did you build the feature (what tools, technologies, and frameworks did you use and why)
  - React JS, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL db, hosted on heroku
  - I'm most familiar with React
  - I'm familiar with a variety of backend frameworks, but I think Django requires a lot more setting up and coding, esp for the authentication system and custom user model
    - started Django at first, but quickly realized I didn't have time :P
  - PostgreSQL is a nice db that is the default for Heroku
  - Heroku has free dynos and super fast and easy, also Heroku PostgreSQL has 10k free rows

- Why you chose your additional feature
  - I think admin page is an important feature to have for any website because you'd want to see what users are registering

- A challenge you had during the developmental process and how you worked around it
  - Not enough time, lots of error checks I didn't implement :/, didn't finish email validation, didn't finish admin user table. Started w django, but then a pset came up so switched to Ruby bc it takes less lines to code. Didn't have time to write docs whoooops
