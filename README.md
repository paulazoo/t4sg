Dear Paula,


Thanks so much for applying for Tech for Social Good as a software engineer. We were impressed with your application and your commitment to leveraging technology for positive social change. As such, we wanted to invite you to our interviews between this Thursday and Saturday at this link; you can book in a 30 minute slot here. If you’re unable to make any of those times, please reach out to us at team@sg.hcs.harvard.edu.


Before then, please complete the following coding challenge:


Imagine you’re the only developer on a project where you have to build a user-authenticated webpage where users can register and then log in to their respective accounts. Specifically, technical requirements include:

Unauthenticated homepage

Sign in form

Register form which includes first name, last name, email, password, and bio.

Authenticated homepage that is different from the unauthenticated version

Additionally, please add 1 additional feature of your own choice. Some examples could include a user-uploaded profile photo or admin user account to show existing users.


Feel free to use any technical stack that you’re familiar with, and if you have any questions, please reach out to us at team@sg.hcs.harvard.edu. We are not judging you by the number of features or whether your code is absolutely perfect, but rather hope that you can spend a couple of hours on this and talk about your experience and process working through any challenges.


Before the interview, please prepare a 5-7 minute presentation which will include:

Brief demo and overview of features

How did you build the feature (what tools, technologies, and frameworks did you use and why)

Why you chose your additional feature

A challenge you had during the developmental process and how you worked around it

The rest of the interview will be a standard behavioral interview to check your fit for T4SG.


Thank you for applying and we look forward to speaking with you!


Best,

HCS Tech for Social Good
